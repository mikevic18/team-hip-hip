                    <p id="complaint">As someone who doesn't own a car, it's really frustrating that there are so few public transportation options in Florin. It's hard to get to nearby cities or even to other parts of town without relying on expensive taxis or rideshares.

                    <p id="complaint">Housing in Florin is way too expensive. I've been searching for a new place to live for months, but every rental or for-sale property I've seen is out of my budget. It's just not fair.</p>
                    <p id="complaint-response-red">We understand that affordable housing is a major concern for many Florin residents. While we would like to make housing more accessible to everyone, this is a complex issue that requires coordination with other agencies and organizations.
                        We are working on developing partnerships and programs that can help address this problem, but it may take some time to see results.</p>
